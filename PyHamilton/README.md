<h1>Python For Hamilton Robots</h1>

<p>This repository here refers to all the work I did with <strong>PyHamilton</strong><a href="https://github.com/dgretton/pyhamilton#readme">(LINK TO THEIR PAGE)</a> and other extra experiments I did with the Machines.<p>

<p> I developed codes for Liquid handling with multi-channel pippeting and also integrated other modules to the machines like a Heater Shaker, a robotic arm and
a air-pressure pump.</p>

<p>Implemment PyHamilton on your laboratory by checking the developer's repository:
<a href="https://github.com/dgretton/pyhamilton#readme">LINK HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Installing the Package with pip in your command line:</p>

<code>pip install pyhamilton</code>

<p>I do not own PyHamilton nor do I have the credits for developing it. I can help you getting started but also strongly recommend checking their page. </p>
