<h1>Python for Hamilton robots</h1>

<p><strong>PyHamilton</strong><a href="https://github.com/dgretton/pyhamilton#readme">(LINK TO THEIR PAGE)</a> is a flexible open-source automation package where writting codes for Hamiltons becomes much more easy. 
From Heater shakers, air-pressure pumps, on deck thermocyclers and more, Hamilton machines can execute numerous protocols with High-throughput yields.</p> 

<p>I've recently worked with <strong>PyHamilton</strong><a href="https://github.com/dgretton/pyhamilton#readme">(LINK TO THEIR PAGE)</a> 
writting codes for Liquid handling with multi-channel pippeting. I also integrate other modules to the machines like a Heater Shaker, a robotic arm and
a air-pressure pump.</p>

<p>Implemment PyHamilton on your laboratory by checking the developer's repository:
