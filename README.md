<h1>WELCOME TO MY Robotics PAGE</h1>

<p>My name is Luiza Hesketh and I work with Robots and Synthetic Biology.
I've worked with OPENTRONS, ECHOS and the Hamilton STAR-line robots. In this Page you can find my most recent works with Laboratory automation, protocols I wrote and Bioarts I made. </p>

<p>Feel free to contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luiza-zucchi-hesketh-0020631a5?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3B2%2FIwVtnHTJ2JaJo%2BDehwYg%3D%3Dr">LINKEDIN</a> if you want to know more about my work.</p>

<h2>Python for Hamilton robots</h2>


<p>I've recently worked with <strong>PyHamilton</strong><a href="https://github.com/dgretton/pyhamilton#readme">(LINK TO THEIR PAGE)</a> 
writting codes for Liquid handling with multi-channel pippeting. I also integrate other modules to the machines like a Heater Shaker, a robotic arm and
a air-pressure pump.</p>
  
<p>Implemment PyHamilton on your laboratory by checking the developer's repository:
<a href="https://github.com/dgretton/pyhamilton#readme">LINK HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Installing the Package with pip in your command line:</p>

<code>pip install pyhamilton</code>

<p>The <strong>Plasmid_purification.py</strong> file correspend to finished projects. you can check them out at my <a href="https://github.com/LuHesketh/Python_Stuff/tree/main/PyHamilton">Python for Hamiltons</a> repository.</p>


<h2>Python for making Bioart with ECHO robots</h2>

<p>I used the <strong>BIOPRINTER</strong> Python package for producing living art with Echo robots. It transforms an image into files that a ECHO 
  liquid dispenser can use to print the image to a plate using pigmented yeast or bacteria.</p>
  
<p>You can find out more about this package at the <a href="https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/bioprinter">EDIMBURGH GENOME FOUDRY</a>, the developers of this package.</p>

<p>Installing the Package with pip in your command line:</p>


<code>pip install ez_setup bioprinter</code>.</p>

<p>The <strong>BIOART PNG FILES </strong>correspend to pictures of finished projects. you can check them out at the <a href="https://github.com/LuHesketh/Python_Stuff/tree/main/bioprinter_test">bioprinter_test</a> repository.</p>
