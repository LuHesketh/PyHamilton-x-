Python for Hamilton robots


PyHamilton(LINK TO THEIR PAGE) is a flexible open-source automation package where writting codes for Hamiltons becomes much more easy. 

I also integrate other modules to the machines like a Heater Shaker, a robotic arm and a air-pressure pump.

Implemment PyHamilton on your laboratory by checking the developer's repository: LINK HERE.

Installing the Package with pip in your command line:

pip install pyhamilton
